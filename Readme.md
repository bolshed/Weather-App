This is a weather app using vanilla JS and the openweather.org API. It is displaying basic weather information for your selected city. 

Default city is Berlin.

The min/max temperatures for the current day aren't the actual ones because of the free API limitations. The min/max temps for the next days I took from the forecast in the hours 6h and 15h respectively.

Still work in progress.
